          <p>In 2009, after reading The 4-Hour Workweek,  I started a t-shirt printing company with my brother in Los Angeles. Our focus, other than printing t-shirts, was to build software that automated the business. Two years in we had printed a lot of shirts, but made little progress on the software and were working way more than 4 hours a week. We hired a number of great programmers; however, only when I started programming did we begin to make real progress. What we found was that with a solid understanding of the business, a little bit of programming knowledge went a long way. I continued programming part-time for the next 5 years focusing most of my efforts on building a product catalog that combined over 30,000 SKUs from more than 50 different vendors. I also created an information management system that handled the full project lifecycle from lead generation to account receivables. As I became more knowledgeable about programming, I also began to understand the business at a much deeper level, a stark contrast to when we started the company knowing nothing about the business or programming.</p>
